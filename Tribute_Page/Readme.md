FreeCodeCamp tribute page project

Create a tribute page with text, a link to a site with additional information, and at least one picture.

This was my first full project for FreeCodeCamp. I learned more CSS styling as I tried to line up my wells, and create a hanging indent
effect for my unordered list.
